Please see RDC.pdf for explanation.

TibsSimuDim is the Matlab code for HD1 and HD2 (the first two numerical section in RDC).
TibsSimuDim2 is the Matlab code for HD3 (the last numerical section in RDC).

HD1 is y=f(x*A) with fixed decay A

HD2 is y=f(x*A) with random decay A

HD3 is y=f(x)*A with fixed decay A
